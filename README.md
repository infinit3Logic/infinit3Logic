## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love programming and I'm sure this is something that I want to do for the rest of my life.
I'm currently learning C++ programming language.
after finishing a simple C++ tutorial in 'w3schools.com', Now in 'Github' I want to create a journal for everything that I'm learning on C++ and much more such as:
- Creating a branch (folders, files or what should I do) for every questions I found, put them here, work on them and solve them, for mastering on 'Problem Solving Skill'
- creating a branch for every intresting things that I learned while solving different problems and creating Projects.
- creating a branch for what should I learn to getting better and better every single day

And I will appreciate everyone who reads this README file and sending me questions and projects in C++ that seems intresting to them in every skill levels,
I promise that eventually I will understand how to solve them as I'm growing.

In addition I'm completetly new in 'github' and using it, so why not learning it too !!
That's it !! This README file is getting updates...
